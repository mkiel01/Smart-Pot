# Arduino Smart Pot
The Arduino Smart-Pot is a project that utilizes Arduino microcontrollers to create an automated plant care system. It allows users to monitor and control essential parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, enabling optimal plant growth and care through an automated watering process.

## About
The project is built for Arduino Uno board.

The project consists of
- Arduino uno
- DHT 11 temperature and humidity sensor
- lcd1602 
- l2C converter for lcd1602
- lm 39 soil moisture sensor
- mini water pump 3-6v 
- breadboard
- cables
- 9v battery 
- plug adapter for battery 
- Iduino SE045 water level sensor
- Iduino relay module - 1 channel - 10A/250VAC contacts - 5V coil* (SONGLE SRD-05VDC-SL-C)

## Getting started 
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation
_Below is an example of how you can install and set up your app._

1. Download Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
2. Download appropriate libraries for sensors and import them into Arduino IDE https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/5145457742236-Add-libraries-to-Arduino-IDE
3. Test the sensors based on the code provided in the corresponding resportiories for example water sensor testing [code](https://github.com/mkiel01/Smart-Pot/blob/main/water_sens/water_sens/water_sens.ino) you will also find pictures of the connections in the repository  
4. Clone the repo
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
    ```
   
5. Connect the parts accordingly to the scheme [electronic connections](https://github.com/mkiel01/Smart-Pot/blob/main/electrical%20connections/electrical%20part%20list%20.pdf)
 and pictures below
6. Run the code
   
## Usage
Based on my code. 
You can personalize it for your own implementation.
